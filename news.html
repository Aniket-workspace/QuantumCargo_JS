                    <p>Since the past 5 years, India has been trying very hard to compete with the Chinese economy! And whenever we speak about competing with China, the Indian media houses talk about how the chinese population is sinking and our population is booming!! How their population is aging and our population is young and strong!! And every other media house is selling us a dream that India will surpass the chinese economy in the next few decades!!</p>

                    <h5>Logistics of the Future | Free Documentary</h5>
                    <p>Modern logistics! It would be hard to imagine our daily digital lives without them. As consumers, we can shop online every day and any hour of the day. We expect everything to arrive on time – whether clothing, printer spare parts or a set of screws. Online shopping is booming: in 2018, courier, express and parcel services, the so-called CEP sector, delivered around 3.5 billion shipments in Germany alone. And this is an upward trend. But how does all this work so smoothly, safely and on time? </p>

                    <p>On 17th September, 2022, the prime minister of India made grand announcement of the national logistics policy and the unified logistics interface, and just like UPI revolutionised the payment industry in India, this policy is expected to revolutionise the entire logistics industry of India, including Road, Rail, Waterways and even air logistics! and more importantly, in this extremely competitive international market, its expected to evolve India into a fierce competitor not just in ASIA but all across the world!! but as usual, while most media houses copy pasted the prime minister announcement of NLP, very few of them actually cared to Explain how exactly will transform the logistics of India!! </p>

                    <p>As supply chain chaos causes shipping delays this holiday season, experts say Amazon’s logistics empire and predictive analytics will allow it to avoid the worst of it. Amazon leased long-haul planes to get goods from China to the U.S. faster, and its been making its own containers and chartering private cargo vessels for years. Now retailers like Walmart, Home Depot, Target, IKEA and Costco are trying out the tactic, chartering smaller vessels to bring goods to less congested ports.</p>

                    <p>Trucking is an especially fragmented industry, which makes it susceptible to continuous boom and bust cycles. While the pandemic wreaked havoc on several industries, trucking is no exception: the industry as a whole is experiencing a shortage of drivers, high turnover rates, and order delays, among a slew of other problems. With 40% of the global economy dependent on freight and logistics, the industry's issues resonate across supply chains and through other dependent industries.</p>
